## Space Shooter Game!

This is my **Pygame Project** for the [Python is Cool, Kids](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a3Milst2XlIqqP9XPohaC3kSzUsxZYlScfweBBPonpUQ1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=697bf8af-9a97-4fc2-accf-85d0e14c8aa7&tenantId=403ee5f4-55b3-45cd-8ae2-824be887a075). 

To play: Run  space_shooter_game.ipynb file from your terminal. cd into the repo folder and run the following code:

And play the game!! 

Move with W,A,S,D keys. Use Spacebar to shoot lasers.
Press ESC to pause or to go back in the game modes.

Play with your with friend in **Multiplayer** mode! 

Types of errors:-	
-	error : display Surface quit  OR       (arises due to abruptly closing game as it was in loop) 
-	error : video system not initialized          (arises due to abruptly closing game from main menu)

Both are completely fine and does not affect the game/code.

Enjoy! :)
